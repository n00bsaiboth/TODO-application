## About this application

This application was part of the essential Javascript trainning course, on the Department of Future Technologies at Turku University. Have to say that this is an early version of it (because there seems to be more bugs, than features), couldn't find the latest version. I think it lies here, somewhere on my computer. I'm quite sure I also made an object oriented version of this, with less bugs and more features.
